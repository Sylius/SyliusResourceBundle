## UPGRADE FOR `1.9.x`

### FROM `1.8.x` TO `1.9.x`

- `translations`:

New configuration options were introduced to set the default and the defined (enabled) locales used by the default translation locale provider (`sylius.translation_locale_provider.immutable` service):

```yaml
sylius_resource:
    translation:
        enabled_locales: []
        default_locale: null
```

Before version `1.9.x` the provider was configured with `locale` parameter.
If those options are not configured, for backward compatibility, it will fallback to the `locale` parameter if it's defined.
This is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
If you want to keep using the `locale` parameter starting with version 2.0, then add the following configuration:

```yaml
sylius_resource:
    translation:
        enabled_locales: ['%locale%']
        default_locale: '%locale%'
```

Starting with version 2.0, the default values will be set from  `kernel.default_locale` and `kernel.enabled_locales` parameters.


```yaml
sylius_resource:
    translation:
        enabled_locales: ['%kernel.enabled_locales%']
        default_locale: '%kernel.default_locale%'
```

## UPGRADE FOR `1.3.x`

### FROM `1.3.x` TO `1.3.13`

If you're using an "Accept" HTTP header to set the serialization groups, you need to define allowed groups
either by passing them as default in `serialization_groups` setting or marking them as allowed in 
`allowed_serialization_groups` setting, both settings are set in the route definition (under `_sylius` key).

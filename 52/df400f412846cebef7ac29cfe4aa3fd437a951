@lchrusciel @pamil Is there anything blocking this? We would love to use Sylius + Symfony 5 but we're still locked due too few things :(

Hey Joseph, we are blocked mostly by our current commitments. We will enter a feature freeze next week, so probably we will put more effort into Symfony5 compatibility since then.

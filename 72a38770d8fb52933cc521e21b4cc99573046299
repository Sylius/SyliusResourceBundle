Hi, I added some PHP Spec tests. I am not sure about it but I don't know how to setup the test application for this plugin.
I don't see PHP Unit tests actually managing some redirection on this plugin.

Just look at the CI to see how it is set up :)

I would like to run the CI to check my tests, I think it's the easiest solution

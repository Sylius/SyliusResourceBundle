@mbabker During internal discussions, we suggest to duplicate the services (both with IDs and FQCN) and adding deprecations to the IDs ones. WDYT?

@mbabker Exactly what I did here for only 2 services for now #549

I think that'd be a little overkill.  At that point, you have two independent services and an asinine number of logged container deprecations that you can't do anything about.

The closest that Symfony suggests to a naming convention for service IDs in bundles in the [best practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/best_practices.html#services) is prefixing service IDs.  That to me implies that it's better for bundles to not use FQCN's as service IDs, and to purposefully create aliases for the FQCN of interfaces that a service defines where it's feasible.

I think we have to add these librairies on conflict to prevent installing older versions than compatible ones. See Symfony composer requirements...

I'd like to test prod requirements too. but I don't manage to launch clear cache command on --env=prod after composer install --no-dev. Test app still have test env...

@pamil @lchrusciel I need help to test prod requirements. It doesn't work with my last commit.
When I run this command "(cd src/Bundle/test && app/console cache:clear --env=prod)" I am on test environment.

Hey Loic, sorry for not being to responsive. We had a few commitments that we had to fulfill recently. However, with 1.8 release coming, you can expect more power to review and push things further.

In the same time, thanks a lot for your patience and work :)

@pamil @lchrusciel I rebased this PR to fix conflicts. I can squash all commits into one if you want.

Hey Loic,

thanks for your contribution and again sorry for the long feedback loop. However, we have to fix the main build before we can go anywhere further.

@lchrusciel I fixed the Ci build.

@lchrusciel @pamil This one is ready and build is fixed. Is there anything else to improve?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@lchrusciel I made a little change to use `on-invalid="null"`, it allows to remove a compiler pass just for that case.
